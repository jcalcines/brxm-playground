            <![CDATA[
            Pivotal Spring Framework through 5.3.16 suffers from a potential remote code execution (RCE) issue if used
            for Java deserialization of untrusted data. Depending on how the library is implemented within a product,
            this issue may or not occur, and authentication may be required. NOTE: the vendor's position is that
            untrusted data is not an intended use case. The product's behavior will not be changed because some users
            rely on deserialization of trusted data.
